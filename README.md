<h1>Data Analysis: From Excel to Power BI (Microsoft) </h1>
This personal project is inspired by a section of the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It shows a basic implementation of PowerBI and a typical Data Analysis Workflow. This was my first time using Power BI. 
</p>
Considering my personal computer is a Macbook, I needed to set up a Windows 10 Virtual Machine, with Azure, to access Microsoft Power BI. I used mock sales data, found online, in CSV form to create the visualizations. Once the visualizations were created, I exported them to PDF. 
</p>
This project, while basic, has opened my mind to the potential of Power BI and how I can integrate the use of this powerful tool with my existing professional use and understanding of Google Analytics (GA4). I am excited to continually dive deep into Power BI and other Data Analysis tools in the near future. <br />
